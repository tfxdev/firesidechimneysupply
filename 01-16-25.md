Current PDF url: https://firesidechimneysupply.com/pdf/FiresideChimneySupplyChaseCoverWorksheet.pdf

New PDF url: https://firesidechimneysupply.com/media/pdf/FiresideChaseWorksheet.pdf

---

## Uploading PDF to the server
- Uploaded a PDF into the folder pub/media/pdf
- the pdf is accessible through this link https://firesidechimneysupply.com/media/pdf/FiresideChaseWorksheet.pdf
- Trying to replace the url "https://firesidechimneysupply.com/pdf/FiresideChimneySupplyChaseCoverWorksheet.pdf" with the  new url "https://firesidechimneysupply.com/media/pdf/FiresideChaseWorksheet.pdf"
- Couldnot save the product because the attribute is required.
- Notified client, waiting for his response ...
- The link I am working on right now is https://firesidechimneysupply.com/admin/catalog/product/edit/id/1418/set/4/key/aec28b1b8e2f6e4a4066c905b57793577d40c5f96bab631b4af9080257924694/type/simple/store/0/back/edit/
- I edited the link for this product but nothing changed in the frontnd.
- I am undoing the changes for this product https://firesidechimneysupply.com/admin/catalog/product/edit/id/1418/set/4/key/aec28b1b8e2f6e4a4066c905b57793577d40c5f96bab631b4af9080257924694/type/simple/store/0/back/edit/
- Saved the product to it's innitial state and set back the pdf URL to https://firesidechimneysupply.com/pdf/FiresideChimneySupplyChaseCoverWorksheet.pdf

---

- Searching for the product again
- Found two products.
- Editing : https://firesidechimneysupply.com/admin/catalog/product/edit/id/1836/set/4/key/aec28b1b8e2f6e4a4066c905b57793577d40c5f96bab631b4af9080257924694/type/simple/store/0/back/edit/
- Changed the URL
- Saved the product
- Replace worked correctly (TESTED)

---

- Checking second product: https://firesidechimneysupply.com/admin/catalog/product/edit/id/1975/key/aec28b1b8e2f6e4a4066c905b57793577d40c5f96bab631b4af9080257924694/
- Found same old PDF url in the second product
- Did set product Attributes 0.0, this is for additional required field. Not related to what I am doing. (client confirmed this but can be checked for more confirmation from the company)
- Changing old PDF URL to the new PDF url
- Saved the product
- Could not test the product, could not found in the frontend. But it might be working properly.

---

**Recommendation**
- Parent product also have the old PDF url. But that URL doesnot work because of error in the link text. It can be replaced. But I am not sure if that url (or the product description entirely) is being showen in the frontend at all or not.

- END
